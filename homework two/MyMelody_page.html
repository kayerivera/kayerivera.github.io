				My Melody was born in the forest of Mariland. Her favorite hobby is baking cookies with her mother, and her favorite food is almond pound cake. She enjoys eating cake with her best friend, a mouse named Flat.

				 Mai, frequently known for short as My Melo, Hello Kittyâ€˜s best friend, is a white rabbit from the Japanese characterization company Sanrio. When she debuted, she was portraying Little Red Riding Hood in her version of the classic fairy tale. That is why she wears a red (or pink) hood that covers her ears, often having a bow or a flower on her right side. She is a very honest, good-natured girl. Her favorite food is almond pound cake. She was born on January 18th in the magical forest of Mariland, the home to many of her friends.
			</p>
			<p>
				My Melody's younger brother Rhythm can be a little bit of a rascal, but she loves him dearly. Her mama enjoys doing crafts and loves baking cookies with her. Her gentle, strong papa must be where she gets her kind disposition. Her treasured hood was made just for her by her very knowledgeable grandma, while her grandpa loves adventures!
			</p>
			<p>
				She is best friends with Flat, a blue mouse who is a bit shy, and she is typically very friendly towards her rival Kuromi. My Melody's best friend is My Sweet Piano, a pink sheep who is soft, kind and girly.
