				Kuromi is a tomboy, but behind her tough appearance, she is actually very girly. She enjoys writing in her diary and reading romance novels.
			</p>
			<p>
				Her favorite colors are black and hot pink. Her favorite food is shallots, all kinds of meat, and in recent Kuromi merchandise cherries have been shown. Despite being a villain, Kuromi is mostly into food and even cooks. You might call her a rowdy free spirit.
			</p>
			<p>
				Kuromi is the "punk" tomboy counterpart to My Melody. Although My Melody has warm feelings for Kuromi, Kuromi's feelings are more inclined to rivalry to look tough.
			</p>
			<p>
				Kuromi is the leader of a biker gang known as "Kuromi's 5." Other members include a purple cat named Nyanmi, a pale orange dog named Wanmi, a white fox named Konmi, and a grey and white rat named Chumi. They all wear black and drive around in a menacing fashion. They love riding their tricycles and causing havoc at breakneck speeds, similar to the yakuza-inspired "bosozoku" girl gang subculture in Japan.
