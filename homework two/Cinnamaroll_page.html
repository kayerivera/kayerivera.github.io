			<p>
				a Sanrio character who was born on March 6, 2001, on a cloud far up in the sky. He is a little chubby male dog with white fur, blue eyes, pink cheeks, a plump and curly tail that resembles a cinnamon roll, and long ears that enable him to fly.
			</p>
			<p>
				Cinnamoroll was created by Miyuki Okumura for Sanrio in 2001. For the first year as a dog, he was named Cinnamon, but to remedy any problems with the registration of the trademark overseas, as of 2007, his official name became Cinnamoroll.
